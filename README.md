=== TITLE ===

Personal Portfolio Website x Start2Impact

=== DESCRIPTION ===

Here is my project for Start2Impact, a digital italian university. The project aimed to create a website showcasing my skills and experience.

=== DIRECTORY ORGANIZATION ===

The website has two html pages: index.html (homepage) and portfolio_more.html (to showcase all the portfolio for when I will have many more projects)

The index.html page is divided into 5 sections:
- Home
- About
- Portfolio
- CV
- Contact

The assets directory includes:
- css: contains style.css, the only stylesheet of the website
- cv: contains the PDF format of my CV
- img: contains all the images used in the website
- js: contains the only js file, main.js
- portfolio: contains the PDF versions of all my projects

In the whole code, the sections are well-divided with comments, for an easy scrolling.
